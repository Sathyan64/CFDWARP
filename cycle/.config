help     Choose "Standard" for implicit dual time stepping or "Predictor-Corrector" for explicit time stepping. "Multizone" is an alternative approach at dual time stepping which splits the domain in various zones and only allocates computing effort to the zones where the residual is above the convergence threshold (not compatible with MPI). "Multizone Marching" is a variant of the "Multizone" cycle for steady supersonic flows.
