The original NASA thermo data file format was documented in:

S. Gordon and B.J. McBride, "Computer Program for Calculation of Complex
Chemical Equilibrium Composition, Rocket Performance, Incident and Reflected
Shocks and Chapman-Jouguet Detonations", NASA SP-273 (1971).

The following information is quoted directly from that document.
Eqs. 90, 91, and 92 give polynomial functions for the specific heat,
enthalpy, and entropy.  The coefficients are given as data.

Eq. 90: cp0/R=a1+a2T+a3*T^2+a4*T^3+a5*T^4
Eq. 91: H0_T/(RT)=a1+a2/2*T+a3/3*T^2+a4/4*T^3+a5/5*T^4+a6/T
Eq. 92: S0_T/R=a1*ln(T)+a2*T+a3/2*T^2+a4/3*T^3+a5/4*T^4+a7

Gaseous species and condensed species with only one condensed phase can be in
any order.  However, the sets for two or more condensed phases of the same
species must be adjacent.  If there are more than two condensed phases of
a species, their sets must be either in increasing or decreasing order
according to their temperature intervals.

The following example illustrates a thermo data file with a single species.
Additional species would be added by duplicating lines 3 through 6:

Notes:
1. The minimum and maximum temperatures given on the second line of the
 file are meant to be global min and max values, where each species
 provides a specific, presumably more restrictive, range.  The middle
 temperature on the second line is the common temperature for the high
 and low temperature ranges for all species in the file.
2. Some files (such as the example, above) provide an additional value
 in the normally unused last field.  This is the enthalpy of formation,
 divided by the gas constant, and is redundant with Eq. 91.
3. Although the use of columns 66 to 79 of the first line of species data 
 is not specified, it is often used for the molecular weight.
