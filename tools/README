prandtlmeyer.c     find the x and y position of a prandtl-meyer compression surface
inlet.c            for an external compression shcramjet, find the altitude of flight as well
                   as all properties in the inlet given the flight Mach number and inlet length
bdry.c             find the boundary layer thickness and skin friction coefficient of laminar
                   and turbulent compressible/incompressible boundary layers
shear.c            find the convective Mach number and shear layer growth of a turbulent shear layer
inletgeom.c        finds an external compression inlet geometry given the two flow turning angles
                   and the flight mach number and inlet length
shock.c            finds the properties after a normal shock, given the mach number and gamma of the flow
                   before the shock (shock is assumed stable in reference frame glued to shock)
wedge.c            finds the properties after an oblique shock (weak solution) given gamma, and the
                   Mach number, and the flow turning angle
rocket_v2.c        find the x,y contours of a nozzle 


search.sh          a script from caldera that lists the files (recursively in all subdirectories)
                   that contain the string specified as the first argument
subword.sh         a script that substitutes in all .c .h .i files (recursively in all subdirectories)
                   word A (=argument 1) by word B (=argument 2)
substr.sh          same as subword but string A (=argument 1) by string B (=argument 2)
tarwarp.sh         a script that (if run from the directory where the warp directory is) creates
                   a new version of warp. For example, tarwarp.sh 01nov15 would create a new directory
                   named warp.01nov15 and create a tarball warp.01nov15.tgz copied from the current
                   warp directory.
